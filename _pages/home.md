## About Me

Hi! My name is Maximilian Gartz and I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [ML6](https://www.ml6.eu/), 
where I work on a variety of custom Machine Learning solutions for clients in many industries like 
retail, insurance or material sciences. I am passionate about Software Engineering 
and ML with a strong interest in MLOps and more generally DevOps.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science from the [University of Osnabr√ºck](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/en.html).
There, I mostly focused on Machine Learning, Mathematics and Bayesian Statistics leading to my thesis on 
[Hamiltonian Normalizing Flows for Bayesian Inference](assets/files/bachelor-thesis.pdf). 
During my studies I worked as a Backend Software Engineer on IoT related projects at the 
[Inside M2M GmbH](https://www.inside-m2m.de/).

Before getting into the world of Software and Machine Learning, I got a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering 
from the [Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau](https://en.th-wildau.de/) with a Bachelor's Thesis on 
production planning at [Volkswagen AG](https://www.volkswagen.de/de.html).

When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends or go to the gym.
